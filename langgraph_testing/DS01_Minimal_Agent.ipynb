    "        - All student data reported in the PIRLS international reports (but not the dataset we have access to) are weighted by the overall student sampling weight. (see https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/P21_MP_Ch3-sample-design.pdf).\n",
    "        - the database contains benchmarking participants, which results in the fact that some countries appear twice.\n",
    "        - some countries had to delay the PIRLS evaluation to a later time (e.g. start of fifth grade), thus increasing the average age of participating students (see https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/files/A-1_students-assessed.xlsx)\n",
    "        - some countries' results are flagged due to reservations about reliability because the percentage of students with achievement was too low for estimation (see https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/files/1_1-2_achievement-results-1.xlsx).\n",
    "        - some assessments focus on benchmarking specific participant groups, often covering only a particular city or region rather than an entire country, e.g. Moscow City in the Russian Federation (see https://www.iea.nl/studies/iea/pirls/2021).\n",
