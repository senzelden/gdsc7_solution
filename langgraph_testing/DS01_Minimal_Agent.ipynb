Varied impact: The effect was not uniform across all countries, with some experiencing larger declines than others.\\n\\n3. Learning loss: Extended school closures and disruptions to education likely contributed to learning losses in reading skills.\\n\\n4. Digital divide: Inequalities in access to technology and remote learning resources may have exacerbated the impact on some students.\\n\\n5. Younger students: The pandemic's effects were often more pronounced for younger students who were in critical early stages of reading development.\\n\\n6.

    "        \n",
    "        ### Limitations\n",
    "        - All student data reported in the PIRLS international reports (but not the dataset we have access to) are weighted by the overall student sampling weight. (see https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/P21_MP_Ch3-sample-design.pdf).\n",
    "        - the database contains benchmarking participants, which results in the fact that some countries appear twice.\n",
    "        - some countries had to delay the PIRLS evaluation to a later time (e.g. start of fifth grade), thus increasing the average age of participating students (see https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/files/A-1_students-assessed.xlsx)\n",
    "        - some countries' results are flagged due to reservations about reliability because the percentage of students with achievement was too low for estimation (see https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/files/1_1-2_achievement-results-1.xlsx).\n",
    "        - some assessments focus on benchmarking specific participant groups, often covering only a particular city or region rather than an entire country, e.g. Moscow City in the Russian Federation (see https://www.iea.nl/studies/iea/pirls/2021).\n",
    "        - A lot of countries did not participate in PIRLS 2021 (e.g. Cameroon, Venezuela, Tunisia). Those might be captured in regional assessments (e.g. PASEC (Programme for the Analysis of Education Systems, ERCE (Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study)), see https://tcg.uis.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/06/Rosetta-Stone_Policy-Brief_2022.pdf for further information.  \n",

    "        ## Final report output design (if not forbidden by user query)\n",
    "        The output format is markdown.\n",
    "        ALWAYS base your output on numbers and citations to provide good argumentation.\n",
    "        ALWAYS write your final output in the style of a data loving and nerdy UNESCO data and statistics team that LOVES minimalist answers that focus on SQL queries, numbers, percentages, correlations and distributions.\n",
    "        ALWAYS be as precise as possible in your argumentation and condense it as much as possible.\n",
    "        (unless the question is out of scope) ALWAYS start the output with a one-sentence summary, followed by paragraphs for all key findings.\n",
    "        ALL paragraphs should contain visualization(s), followed by the data details (in a table if applicable and including statistical analysis), followed by an interpretation.\n",
    "        ALWAYS end the out put with a follow-up question that is wrapped in code block and a disclaimer in the style of ChatGPT (\"This content has been generated by an artificial intelligence language model. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date.\")\n",
    "        ALWAYS start the output with a summary in the style of brutal simplicity.\n",
    "        ALWAYS use unordered lists. NEVER use ordered lists.\n",
    "        ALWAYS transform every ordered list into an unordered list.\n",
    "        ALWAYS reduce the amount of text as much as possible.\n",
    "        ALWAYS only generate bullet points that have numbers, percentages or citations from previous steps.\n",
    "        ALWAYS provide further proof to your analysis by scraping text from websites or PDFs and integrate citations from these scraping activities directly into the output.\n",
    "        ALWAYS compare data from multiple perspectives and step back to provide a holistic answer to the user question.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Data from the database always has priority, but should be accompanied by findings from other sources if possible.\n",
    "        ALWAYS check your findings against the limitations (e.g. did the country delay it's assessment, are there reservations about reliability) and mention them in the final output.\n",
    "        In order to understand the limitations ALWAYS find out whether the assessment was delayed in the relevant countries by quering the Appendix: https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/files/A-1_students-assessed.xlsx.\n",
    "        ALWAYS verify that you are not repeating yourself. Keep it concise!\n",
    "        ALWAYS answer questions that are out of scope with a playful and witty 4 line poem in the style of Sappho that combines the user question with PIRLS and add a description of PIRLS 2021 and a link to the PIRLS website (https://pirls2021.org/).\n",
    "        NEVER hallucinate numbers or citations. Only write based on results from previous steps.\n",
    "        ALWAYS be transparent about missing data (e.g. if a country didn't participate in PIRLS).\n",

    "        '''\n",
    "        Several key factors emerge as significant influences on students' reading achievement. 📚\n",
    "\n",
    "        ### Number of Books at Home\n",
    "        There's a strong positive correlation between the number of books at home and reading scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "        <visualization>\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Students with \"Many books\" scored an average of 538.09 [PIRLS 2021: A-1_students-assessed.xlsx](https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/files/A-1_students-assessed.xlsx).  \n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Those with \"Almost none\" or \"None\" scored 387.81 and 369.04 respectively.  \n",
    "        \n",
    "        This suggests that access to reading materials at home plays a crucial role in reading achievement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "        ### Internet Access\n",
    "        Internet access at home is associated with higher reading scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - With internet access: 513.34\n",
    "    \n",
    "        This highlights the potential importance of digital resources in supporting reading skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ### Time Spent Reading Outside School\n",
    "        Students who read more outside of school tend to perform better:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        <visualization>\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - 30 minutes or more: 516.05\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - No time: 405.32\n",
    "        \n",
    "        This underscores the value of encouraging regular reading habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ### Reading for Fun\n",
    "        Frequent reading for pleasure correlates with higher scores:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        <visualization>\n",

    "        - Once or twice a month: 490.08\n",
    "        \n",
    "        This suggests that fostering a love for reading can positively impact achievement.\n",
    "\n",

      "{'p': ['The PIRLS 2021 results contribute to the large body of existing research showing a strong positive relationship between students’ socioeconomic environment and their educational achievement.', 'New for PIRLS 2021, the Home Socioeconomic Status scale, or “home SES” scale, was adapted from the Home Resources for Learning scale reported in previous PIRLS cycles, which combined data from both fourth grade students and their parents. The updated PIRLS 2021 SES scale is based solely on parents’ data collected using the PIRLS 2021 Home Questionnaire.', 'As shown in “About the Scale,” the PIRLS 2021 Home Socioeconomic Status scale is based on parents’ reports of resources within the home, as well as parental self-reports on education and occupation. Based on the scores for the SES scale, students were placed into three regions—“higher,” “medium,” and “lower” home SES according to their parents’ reports.', 'Exhibit 5.1 presents for each country the percentages of students classified as having a “higher,” “middle,” or “lower” home SES accompanied by the percentages and average reading achievement of the students in each category. Countries are ordered by the percentage of students with “higher” SES, from highest to lowest.', 'Internationally, on average, 29 percent of the students were classified as having “higher” home SES, 48 percent with “middle” home SES, and 23 percent with “lower” home SES. Internationally, the results show a large difference of 86 points in average reading achievement between students with “higher” SES and “lower” SES (542 vs. 456). The average reading achievement for students with “middle” SES was 500 scale score points.', 'Mullis, I. V. S., von Davier, M., Foy, P., Fishbein, B., Reynolds, K. A., & Wry, E. (2023).
