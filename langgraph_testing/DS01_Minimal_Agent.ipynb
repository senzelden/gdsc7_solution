      "INTERPRETATION:\n",
      "- **Reading Skills**: All performance levels place \"major emphasis\" on improving reading skills and comprehension, indicating a universal recognition of its importance.\n",
      "- **Literary Experience**: High-performing countries tend to place \"major emphasis\" on reading for literary experience, while medium and low performers give it \"some emphasis\". This suggests that exposure to diverse literary texts might contribute to higher achievement.\n",
      "- **Reading for Information**: Interestingly, low-performing countries place \"major emphasis\" on reading to acquire information, while high and medium performers give it \"some emphasis\". This could indicate a need for balance between informational and literary texts.\n",
      "- **Reading for Enjoyment**: High performers emphasize reading for enjoyment more than medium and low performers. This aligns with research suggesting that fostering a love for reading can improve overall reading achievement [https://pirls2021.org/results/context-home/reading-attitudes].\n",
      "- **Digital Reading Skills**: All performance levels show \"little or no emphasis\" on digital reading skills. This uniform lack of focus suggests a potential area for curriculum development across all countries, especially given the increasing importance of digital literacy [https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Exhibit-7-Policies-About-Digital-Literacy-in-the-Reading-Curriculum.pdf].\n",
      "\n",
      "LIMITATIONS:\n",
      "- The analysis is based on self-reported curriculum emphasis, which may not always reflect actual classroom practices.\n",
      "- Some countries delayed their PIRLS assessment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could affect the comparability of results [https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/files/A-1_students-assessed.xlsx].\n",
