    "        Final Output Example:\n",
    "        '''\n",
    "        The PIRLS 2021 dataset shows that home language, access to books, and teacher experience are key factors in reading achievement:\n",
    "\n",
    "        🏠 Home Language Environment\n",
    "        The data shows varying levels of exposure to the test language at home:\n",
    "\n",
    "        🗣️ 58% of students always speak the test language at home\n",
    "        🗣️ 22% sometimes speak the test language and sometimes another language\n",
    "        🗣️ 16% almost always speak the test language at home\n",
    "        🗣️ 5% never speak the test language at home\n",

    "        <chart>\n",
    "        \n",
    "        INTERPRETATION:\n",
    "        - This distribution suggests that language exposure at home could be a significant factor in reading achievement. \n",
    "        - Students who have more exposure to the test language at home may have an advantage in developing their reading skills\n",
    "        \n",
    "        LIMITATIONS:\n",
    "        - **Assessment Delays**: Some countries delayed their PIRLS assessment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may affect the comparability of results. For instance, Norway assessed students in 5th grade instead of 4th grade, which could influence their performance [https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/files/A-1_students-assessed.xlsx].\n",

    "\n",
    "        ### Limitations\n",
    "        - All student data reported in the PIRLS international reports are weighted by the overall student sampling weight, known as TOTWGT in the PIRLS international databases. (see https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/P21_MP_Ch3-sample-design.pdf).\n",
    "        - the database contains benchmarking participants, which results in the fact that some countries appear twice.\n",
    "        - some countries had to delay the PIRLS evaluation to a later time (e.g. start of fifth grade), thus increasing the average age of participating students (see https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/files/A-1_students-assessed.xlsx)\n",
    "        - some countries' results are flagged due to reservations about reliability because the percentage of students with achievement was too low for estimation (see https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/files/1_1-2_achievement-results-1.xlsx). \n",
    "\n",
    "        '''\n",
    "        Reading achievement results are included in PIRLS 2021 International Results in Reading for all 57 countries and 8 benchmarking entities that participated in PIRLS 2021. \n",
    "        Concerns about the comparability of the data resulting from COVID-19 school disruptions and delayed testing complicated reporting the PIRLS 2021 results.\n",
    "\n",
    "        PIRLS and TIMSS have built a reputation for reporting high quality data, but not all data collected meet the expected guidelines. \n",
    "        In such cases, PIRLS and TIMSS use annotations to identify results based on data that for some reason fell short of meeting the expected guidelines. \n",
    "        The goal is to be clear about issues while still reporting countries’ data. \n",
    "\n",
    "        Because the pandemic was unprecedented in the history of PIRLS trend assessments, the trends between 2016 and 2021 are shown with dotted lines. \n",
    "        This should alert researchers that care should be taken when interpreting the PIRLS 2021 results. \n",
    "        Similar to the approach used for the PIRLS 2021 achievement data, the trend results for the countries that assessed fourth grade students are in one exhibit, with the “one year later countries” clearly annotated as having a 6-year trend instead of a 5-year trend between 2016 and 2021. \n",
    "        Trend results for the countries with delayed assessments at the fifth grade need to be interpreted with great care due to the age difference and are shown in a separate exhibit.\n",
    "        '''\n",
    "\n",
    "        '''\n",
    "        The average age of students in the 14 countries that delayed assessment until the beginning of the fifth grade was half a year older on average than the average age of students assessed at the end of fourth grade.\n",
    "        Beyond finding that these students were comparatively older, unfortunately, without any information about the reading achievement of the students in the 14 countries at the end of the fourth grade or their activities over the summer months, the PIRLS 2021 data in and of itself cannot be used to disentangle the extent of the impact of the delayed assessment on students’ reading achievement. \n",
    "        Researchers may be able to use within country data and local insights to study this issue in the future.\n",
