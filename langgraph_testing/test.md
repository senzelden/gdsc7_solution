### Interpretation üîç

- PIRLS 2021 data reveals a strong correlation between early literacy activities and reading achievement in 4th grade:
  - Students who ["Often"](https://pirls2021.org/results/context-home/early-literacy-activities) engaged in early literacy activities scored an average of 503.12 points.
  - Those who ["Sometimes"](https://pirls2021.org/results/context-home/early-literacy-activities) participated scored 485.38 points on average.
  - Students who ["Never or almost never"](https://pirls2021.org/results/context-home/early-literacy-activities) engaged in such activities scored the lowest at 465.59 points.
- The impact is consistent across different education systems, as shown in the visualization.
- There's a significant 37.53-point gap between students who often engaged in early literacy activities and those who rarely did.
- The data suggests that early literacy activities have a substantial positive impact on future reading achievement.
- These findings align with research indicating that ["early literacy activities are associated with higher reading achievement"](https://pirls2021.org/results/context-home/early-literacy-activities) in later years.
