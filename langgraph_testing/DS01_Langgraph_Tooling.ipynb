      "Thank you for your question about the average reading scores for the top 10 countries, considering weighted results. I'll provide you with the results and explain the approach I took to obtain this information.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I attempted to calculate the weighted average scores using the TOTWGT (Total Weight) variable. However, the query didn't return any results, which suggests there might be an issue with the data or the way the weights are stored in the database. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given this situation, I proceeded to calculate the unweighted average reading scores for the top 10 countries. Here are the results:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Rank | Country | Average Reading Score |\n",
      "|------|---------|------------------------|\n",
      "| 1 | Moscow City, Russian Federation | 599.01 |\n",
      "| 2 | Singapore | 583.01 |\n",
      "| 3 | Ireland | 578.49 |\n",
      "| 4 | Hong Kong SAR | 574.54 |\n",
      "| 5 | Russian Federation | 571.96 |\n",
      "| 6 | Northern Ireland | 567.03 |\n",
      "| 7 | Croatia | 559.34 |\n",
      "| 8 | United Kingdom | 556.96 |\n",
      "| 9 | United States | 554.77 |\n",
      "| 10 | Quebec, Canada | 553.74 |\n",
      "\n",
      "These results are based on the average ASRREA_avg scores, which represent the overall reading score for each student. \n",
      "\n",
      "A few important points to note:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Moscow City (Russian Federation) is listed separately from the Russian Federation, likely because it was assessed as a benchmark participant.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Some entries, like Northern Ireland and Quebec (Canada), appear to be regions rather than countries. This suggests that the PIRLS study sometimes provides data for specific regions within countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The scores range from about 553 to 599, with Moscow City having a notably higher average score than the other top performers.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The difference between the highest (Moscow City) and the 10th highest (Quebec) is about 45 points, indicating a significant spread even among the top performers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to keep in mind that these are unweighted averages, which means each student's score is given equal importance in the calculation. Weighted averages, had we been able to calculate them, might have provided a slightly different ranking or scores, as they would have accounted for the sampling design and any oversampling of certain populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a more comprehensive analysis, it would be beneficial to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Investigate why the weighted calculation didn't work and try to resolve that issue.\n",
      "2. Look at the distribution of scores within each country, not just the average.\n",
      "3. Consider other factors that might influence these scores, such as socioeconomic status, urban vs. rural settings, or educational policies in these countries.\n",
      "4. Examine how these results compare to previous PIRLS assessments to identify any trends or significant changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there any specific aspect of these results you'd like me to explore further?\n"

      "Based on the data from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics[^1], several factors appear to be driving reading performance in Germany (DEU). The **proportion of students achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in reading** at the end of primary education remained relatively high, at **93.59%** in 2021, although it showed a slight decrease from 94.51% in 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key driver of this performance appears to be **government expenditure on education**. The data shows a consistent increase in government spending on education as a percentage of GDP, rising from 4.86% in 2015 to 5.45% in 2021. This increased investment is reflected in the **initial government funding per primary student**, which grew from 17.68% of GDP per capita in 2015 to 20.40% in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's worth noting that the **proportion of primary schools with access to computers for pedagogical purposes** decreased from 78.14% in 2015 to 53.97% in 2021. This decline in technological resources could potentially impact future reading performance if not addressed.\n",
