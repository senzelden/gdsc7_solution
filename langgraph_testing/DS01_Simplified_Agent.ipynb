      "Certainly! Let me dive into the insights we can draw from the student and teacher questionnaire responses regarding factors influencing reading achievement in PIRLS 2021. Buckle up, fellow data enthusiasts! We're about to embark on a thrilling journey through the world of reading achievement! 📚🔍\n",
      "\n",
      "🎭 KEY FINDINGS\n",
      "\n",
      "• The top-performing entity in reading achievement is Moscow City, Russian Federation, with an average score of `599.03`.\n",
      "• There's a notable gender balance in most countries, with female participation ranging from `44.22%` to `51.05%`.\n",
      "• Surprisingly, our data shows `0.00%` for several important factors across all countries, which requires further investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔬 DETAILED ANALYSIS\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, picture this! Our PIRLS 2021 data is like a giant library 📚, and we're the excited librarians trying to catalog all the books by their covers. Let's see what stories our numbers are telling us!\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 🏆 READING ACHIEVEMENT CHAMPIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "Country                           | Avg_Reading_Score\n",
      "----------------------------------|-------------------\n",
      "Moscow City, Russian Federation   | 599.03\n",
      "Singapore                         | 583.22\n",
      "Hong Kong SAR                     | 575.15\n",
      "Russian Federation                | 572.01\n",
      "Northern Ireland                  | 566.96\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Holy bookworms, Batman! 🦇 Moscow City is leading the pack with a whopping average reading score of 599.03. It's like they've got a secret reading superpower! Singapore and Hong Kong SAR are hot on their heels, forming a trio of reading titans.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 👫 GENDER BALANCE IN READING\n",
      "\n",
      "Our data shows a pretty balanced gender distribution in most countries. It's like a perfectly balanced see-saw at the playground of education! \n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "Country                 | Female_Percentage\n",
      "------------------------|-------------------\n",
      "Denmark                 | 51.05%\n",
      "Hong Kong SAR           | 51.03%\n",
      "United Kingdom          | 50.67%\n",
      "Northern Ireland        | 49.96%\n",
      "Australia               | 49.89%\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Denmark takes the lead with 51.05% female participation, while Alberta, Canada has the lowest at 44.22%. It's fascinating to see that most countries hover around the 50% mark. This suggests that both boys and girls are getting equal opportunities to showcase their reading skills. Go team equality! 🎉\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 🧐 THE MYSTERY OF THE MISSING DATA\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here's where our story takes a twist worthy of an Agatha Christie novel! Our query returned `0.00%` for several important factors across all countries:\n",
      "\n",
      "- High Books Percentage\n",
      "- High Resources Percentage\n",
      "- High Parent Education Percentage\n",
      "- Experienced Teacher Percentage\n",
      "- High Teacher Education Percentage\n",
      "\n",
      "This is more puzzling than a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle of a clear blue sky! 🧩 It's highly unlikely that these percentages are actually zero across the board. This could indicate a few things:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. There might be an issue with how the data is stored or queried in our database.\n",
      "2. The specific codes we used for these factors might not match the actual codes in the database.\n",
      "3. There could be missing data for these particular questions in the survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to investigate this further to get a complete picture of these important factors influencing reading achievement.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 🔍 WHAT WE CAN INFER\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the missing data, we can still draw some insights:\n",
      "\n",
      "a) **Regional Performance**: Eastern Asian regions (Singapore, Hong Kong SAR) and Eastern European countries (Russian Federation, Croatia, Bulgaria) seem to perform exceptionally well in reading achievement. It's like they've got a secret reading recipe! 🥘\n",
      "\n",
      "b) **City vs. Country Performance**: Interestingly, Moscow City outperforms the overall Russian Federation average (599.03 vs 572.01). This suggests that urban areas might have some advantages when it comes to reading achievement. Perhaps it's all those fancy city libraries! 🏙️\n",
      "\n",
      "c) **Gender and Reading Achievement**: There doesn't seem to be a strong correlation between the percentage of female students and average reading scores. For example, Denmark has the highest female percentage (51.05%) but ranks 16th in average reading score.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. 📊 LIMITATIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCH\n",
      "\n",
      "Our analysis comes with a few caveats:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. We're missing crucial data on home resources, parental education, and teacher characteristics. These factors are known to influence reading achievement, so we need to fix our data retrieval to include this information.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. We should investigate why Moscow City performs so much better than other regions. Are there specific educational policies or practices we can learn from?\n",
      "\n",
      "3. It would be interesting to compare these results with previous PIRLS assessments to see trends over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. We need to consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these results, as mentioned in the [PIRLS 2021 International Results in Reading](https://pirls2021.org/results).\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while our data gives us some intriguing insights into reading achievement across different countries, it's clear we need to dig deeper to uncover the full story. It's like we've read the first chapter of a thrilling mystery novel, and now we're eager to turn the page and discover more!\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, in the world of education research, every data point is a clue, and every correlation is a potential breakthrough. So let's keep reading between the lines and writing the story of global reading achievement! 📚🌍\n",
