    "        Data from the database always has priority, but should be accompanied by findings from other sources if possible.\n",
    "        ALWAYS check your findings against the limitations (e.g. did the country delay it's assessment, are there reservations about reliability) and mention them in the final output.\n",
    "        In order to understand the limitations ALWAYS find out whether the assessment was delayed in the relevant countries by quering the Appendix: https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/files/A-1_students-assessed.xlsx.\n",

    "        - some countries' results are flagged due to reservations about reliability because the percentage of students with achievement was too low for estimation (see https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/files/1_1-2_achievement-results-1.xlsx). \n",

    "\n",
    "        PIRLS and TIMSS have built a reputation for reporting high quality data, but not all data collected meet the expected guidelines. \n",

    "        Similar to the approach used for the PIRLS 2021 achievement data, the trend results for the countries that assessed fourth grade students are in one exhibit, with the “one year later countries” clearly annotated as having a 6-year trend instead of a 5-year trend between 2016 and 2021. \n",

      "Hoot hoot! Our data-loving owl team has swooped in with some sharp insights for you! Let's dive into the forest of PIRLS 2021 data and see what we can uncover about South Africa's reading achievements!\n",
      "\n",
      "To answer your question directly: In the PIRLS 2021 study, approximately `4.31%` of students in South Africa reached the Intermediate International Benchmark.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔑 KEY FINDINGS:\n",
      "- Only `4.31%` of South African students reached the Intermediate International Benchmark\n",
      "- South Africa's assessment was delayed, taking place in August-November 2021\n",
      "- The average age of South African students at the time of testing was `10.2 years`\n",
      "- South Africa also participated as a benchmarking participant for Grade 6 students\n",
      "\n",
      "🔍 DETAILED ANALYSIS:\n",
      "\n",
      "Our owl eyes have spotted some interesting details about South Africa's participation in PIRLS 2021:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ASSESSMENT TIMING:\n",
      "South Africa's assessment was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the [PIRLS 2021 information about assessed students](https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/files/A-1_students-assessed.xlsx), South Africa is marked with a \"⊘\" symbol, indicating that the assessment occurred \"one year later than originally scheduled\". The data collection period for South Africa was August-November 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. STUDENT AGE:\n",
      "The average age of South African students at the time of testing was 10.2 years. This is relatively close to the overall average age across participating countries, which ranges from 9.8 to 11.3 years (excluding the Grade 6 benchmarking participants).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. GRADE LEVEL:\n",
      "South Africa assessed students in Grade 4, which aligns with the PIRLS target population of \"the grade that represents four years of schooling counting from the first year of ISCED Level 1\".\n",
      "\n",
      "4. BENCHMARKING PARTICIPATION:\n",
      "Interestingly, South Africa also participated as a benchmarking participant for Grade 6 students. The average age for these Grade 6 students was 12.3 years, significantly older than the Grade 4 participants.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. PERFORMANCE AT THE INTERMEDIATE INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARK:\n",
      "The percentage of students reaching the Intermediate International Benchmark (4.31%) is quite low compared to many other participating countries. This suggests that a significant majority of South African fourth-grade students are struggling to achieve intermediate reading proficiency levels as defined by PIRLS.\n",
      "\n",
      "To put this into perspective, let's look at the PIRLS definition of the Intermediate International Benchmark:\n",
      "\n",
      "> \"Students can independently locate and recognize some details from different parts of the text. They can make straightforward inferences and begin to interpret story events and central ideas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The low percentage of students reaching this benchmark indicates that many South African students may be facing challenges in these fundamental reading skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that these results should be interpreted with caution due to the delayed assessment. The COVID-19 pandemic likely had an impact on students' learning experiences, which could have affected their performance in the PIRLS assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our wise owls suggest that further investigation into factors such as socioeconomic status, language of instruction, and educational resources could provide more context for these results and help identify areas for improvement in South Africa's reading education.\n",
