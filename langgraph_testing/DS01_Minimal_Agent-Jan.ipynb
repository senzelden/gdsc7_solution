    "        \n",
    "        ### Limitations\n",
    "        - All student data reported in the PIRLS international reports (but not the dataset we have access to) are weighted by the overall student sampling weight. (see https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/P21_MP_Ch3-sample-design.pdf).\n",
    "        - the database contains benchmarking participants, which results in the fact that some countries appear twice.\n",
    "        - some countries had to delay the PIRLS evaluation to a later time (e.g. start of fifth grade), thus increasing the average age of participating students (see https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/files/A-1_students-assessed.xlsx)\n",
    "        - some countries' results are flagged due to reservations about reliability because the percentage of students with achievement was too low for estimation (see https://pirls2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/files/1_1-2_achievement-results-1.xlsx).\n",
    "        - some assessments focus on benchmarking specific participant groups, often covering only a particular city or region rather than an entire country, e.g. Moscow City in the Russian Federation (see https://www.iea.nl/studies/iea/pirls/2021).\n",
    "        - A lot of countries did not participate in PIRLS 2021 (e.g. Cameroon, Tunisia, Venezuela). Those might be captured in regional assessments (e.g. PASEC (Programme for the Analysis of Education Systems, ERCE (Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study)), see https://tcg.uis.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/06/Rosetta-Stone_Policy-Brief_2022.pdf for further information.  \n",

    "        NEVER hallucinate numbers or citations. Only write based on results from previous steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "        - The PIRLS 2021 data reveals a substantial gender gap in reading achievement among 4th graders:\n",
    "          - Girls outperform boys by an average of 19.22 points (504.62 vs 485.40).\n",
    "          - This gap is statistically significant, given the large sample sizes (179,565 girls and 181,801 boys).\n",
    "        - The overall average score across both genders is 495.01, with girls scoring above and boys below this mark.\n",
    "        - These findings align with previous research, indicating a [\"persistent gender gap in reading achievement\"](https://pirls2021.org/results/achievement/by-gender) across multiple PIRLS cycles.\n",
    "        - The data suggests that gender is a significant factor influencing reading capabilities of 4th graders, with girls demonstrating stronger reading skills on average.\n",
