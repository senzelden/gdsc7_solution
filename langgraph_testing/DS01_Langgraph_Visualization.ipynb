In 6 countries, delayed test administration due to COVID-19 occurred a full year later at the end of the fourth year of schooling for the next cohort (\\\\u22c8). In 14 Northern Hemisphere countries, delayed test administration occurred half a year later at the beginning of the fifth year of schooling (\\\\u25fc).\\\\n\\\\nIEA has a policy that students do not fall under the minimum average age of 9.5 years old at the time of testing, so England, Malta, and New Zealand assessed students in their fifth year of formal schooling. Norway chose to assess students in the fifth year of schooling so students would be compared with similar age students in Sweden, Denmark, and Finland.\\\\n \\\\nAverage age at the time of testing can vary across countries by just over a year (e.g., from 9.8 to 10.9 years) depending on a country\\\\u2019s policy on age of entry to school and dates of test administration.
