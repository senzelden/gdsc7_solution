The 10-year English Language Syllabus 2010, which covers learning outcomes from primary to secondary levels, aiming to develop critical listening, reading, and viewing skills.\\n\\n3. The Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR) program in primary schools, which aims to \"develop in students a strong foundation in the English language and a love for reading.\"\\n\\n4. Use of various reading strategies including \"decoding through phonics, shared reading, close reading and viewing, critical reading, viewing and appreciation, and extensive reading and viewing.\"\\n\\n5. Emphasis on reading for enjoyment and encouraging students to \"read widely and learn to analyze and evaluate what they read.\"\\n\\n6. Integration of print and digital resources, including \"newspaper articles, print advertisements, photographs, web-based texts, videos, and audio texts.\"\\n\\n7.
