      "is highest for students in Class 2 (520 scale score points), with students in Class 4 having similar \n",
      "achievement on average (516). Note that Classes 2 and 4 are similar in how they reported high \n",

      "The differences in average achievement across classes may be influenced by the differences \n",

      "international average contain a larger proportion of students in higher-performing countries. \n",
      "Hong Kong SAR and Jordan serve as instructive examples. Classes 2 and 4, which have the \n",

      "SAR. Large percentages of students in Hong Kong SAR reported being “Sometimes” or “Often” \n",
      "hungry and tired when arriving at school, while large proportions also reported lower levels of \n",
      "student bullying and rare absences. In contrast, 55 percent of students in Jordan belong to the \n",

      "The profiles created by the ML-LCA procedure and their association with reading \n",
      "achievement provide information about how different well-being indicators, and combinations \n",

      "on the statistical associations of self-reports to find meaningful groups and does not depend on \n",
      "knowing why these patterns may vary across countries. Causality is neither a prerequisite for \n",

      "students who do frequently experience bullying have lower reading achievement \n",

      "Latent class analysis (LCA) is a powerful and versatile statistical method for identifying groups \n",

      "in the research of complex subjective experiences and attitudes in educational contexts, including \n",
