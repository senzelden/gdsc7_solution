    When applicable, search for relevant data in the PIRLS 2021 dataset.
    
    When answering, always:    
    - Do not initiate research for topics outside the area of your expertise.     
    - Ensure that your dataset queries are accurate and relevant to the research questions.
    - Unless instructed otherwise, explain how you come to your conclusions and provide evidence to support your claims with specific data.
    - Prioritize specific findings including numbers and percentages in line with best practices in statistics
    - Data and numbers should be provided in tables to increase readability.
    - Try to go the extra mile for open questions (e.g. correlate data with socioeconomic status, compare across countries within a region, integrate suggestions that you have into your query)
    
  expected_output: >
    A complete answer to the scientific questions from the domain expert with additional context on correlations and causations

understand_question_context:

    Understand the context of the following question:    
    {user_question}
    
    Interpret user queries accurately by understanding the context and nuances of the question in relation to PIRLS 2021.
    Clarify ambiguous queries by asking follow-up questions to narrow down the userâ€™s intent in relation to PIRLS 2021.
    Do not reply to topics outside the area of your expertise.
  expected_output: >
    A general classification of the user question (e.g. closed or open). A concise and specific set of scientific questions that are derived from the user question. The length is dependent on the question type (closed: 1-2 questions, open: 3-5). The output is to be provided in short bullet points.

find_relevant_links_task:
  description: >
    Answer the following question:    
    {user_question}
    
    When applicable, search for relevant data on the PIRLS 2021 website.
  expected_output: >

visualization_task:
  description: >
    Create a visual representation of the data related to the most important research finding:
    
    The visualization should aim to provide clear insights into the dataset, making complex patterns, trends, or comparisons easy to understand.
    
    When creating the visualization, always:
    - Ensure the visual aligns with the overall research narrative and conclusions.
    - Choose the most appropriate chart type (e.g., bar chart, line graph, heat map) for the data presented.
    - Use clear labels, titles, and legends to make the visualization self-explanatory.
    - Simplify the design to avoid overwhelming the viewer with unnecessary details.
    
  expected_output: >
    The output should be a link to the visualization.

analyze_findings_task:
  description: >
    Answer the following question:    
    {user_question}
    
    When answering, always (unless forbidden by the user question):    
    - Do not reply to topics outside the area of your expertise.     
    - Ensure that your analysis is accurate and relevant to the research questions.
    - scrape the PIRLS website for data that is not available in the dataset (e.g. trend data) to find an answer.
    - Unless instructed otherwise, explain how you come to your conclusions and provide evidence to support your claims with specific data.
    - Prioritize specific findings from the data engineer in the final output including numbers and percentages
    - Data and numbers should be provided in tables to increase readability.
    - Use markdown format for your final answer.
    - always summarize the findings first in a short TL;DR in the style of brutal simplicity (like a headline in a tabloid)
    - finish with a sections on further links
    - highlight the most important word or word group in each sentence by setting them to a bold font (e.g. **important**)
    - use capital letters for headlines but no heading font
    - make use of tables to easily summarize the data
    - use horizontal rules to separate paragraphs
    - Your answer should not exceed 3 paragraphs. Keep it concise!
